# My Blog

This is a simple static blog website created using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. The website allows users to create blog posts dynamically on the page, which are stored temporarily in the browser.

## Features
- **Create Blog Posts**: Users can enter a title and content for a new blog post.
- **Display Posts**: Blog posts are displayed below the form as they are added.
- **Local Storage (optional)**: In a more advanced version, posts can be saved across page reloads using local storage (not implemented in this basic version, but can be added).
  
## Files

- `index.html`: The main HTML file that contains the structure of the website.
- `styles.css`: The CSS file that defines the styling of the blog.
- `script.js`: The JavaScript file that handles the creation and display of blog posts.
